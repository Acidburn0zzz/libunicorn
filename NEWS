New in version 0.4

    - "make install" now installs libunicorn.pc

    - Logging functionality has been removed

    - Casemapping has been improved, and new case comparison functions
      have been added.

New in version 0.3

    - Add extended dispatch of IRC messages to hooks

    - Allow hooks to be deleted

    - Change hook calling convention to use pointers supplied at call
      time rather than at hook time.

New in version 0.2

    - The message parser functions now clear out the argument list
      beforehand. Not doing this quickly leads to loads of weird bugs.

    - Hook calling order has been standardized. Hooks are called in the
      order they were added.
